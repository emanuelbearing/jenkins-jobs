# Generating Server Stubs
this job pulls all swagger files from a specified repository and uses the code-generator to generate local and Bluemix server stubs.
The generated stubs are pushed back to a git repositroy.

Note: The job works with the Github Plugin and uses an authentication Token. Since this code is publicly available, the Auth-Token has been removed and must be reentered later again.
